An important note to keep in mind if you modify the set of files in the
assignments.

The install procedure installs the files assignments/PA*/*.* in the
student hierarchy.  Thus, any file you want to have installed must
have a "." somewhere in the filename (e.g., any filename with an
extension).  This convention avoids having the install procedure
attempt to install the CVS subdirectory.

This is admittedly ugly, but at least it is simple.
