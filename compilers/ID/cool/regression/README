=====================================

This directory provides a simple regression testing facility for the
Cool compiler.  There are tests for each phase of the compiler:
lexer, parser, semantic analysis, code generation, and code
generation with garbage collection.  Testing consists of running
test cases and comparing the result (via "diff") with the "BASE"
results.  The code generator is tested by comparing the .s files and
by comparing the results of executing the code on spim.

There is a script "install_results" to update the test results if the
functionality of the compiler changes.  In general, you should NOT install
new results that differ from the old results unless you are SURE the new
results are indeed correct.  The ideal is that the new results are identical
to the old results.

Of course, if you add a new test you must install the new results.
To add new tests:

        1.  Add the file to the BASE... dir.
            The file must have a .test or .cl suffix

        2.  run the appropriate test

        3.  Verify that the new result files in the
	    RESULT... directory are correct.
	    For the code generator, the test files have the extensions:

		cl.result   - compilation stdout
		cl.stderr   - compilation stderr
		cl.s        - compilation produced assembly
		cl.s.result - stdout of run through spim
		cl.s.stderr - stderr of run through spim

        4.  Run install_results.  You will be prompted for which results
	    to install (e.g., for lexer, parser, etc.).  There is no need
	    to install results for a phase if the results didn't change.

        5.  Rerun the test to make sure everything works as expected.
